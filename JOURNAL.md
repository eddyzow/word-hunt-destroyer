# Word Hunt DESTROYER
_supercalifragilisticexpialidocious_

## entry #0 - 6/4

i play a LOT of gamepigeon word hunt. often 10 or more games per day. i'm quite decorated in wins -- as of today I have won 2,188 games! 

while i think i am somewhat skilled at the game, i want to push it to its limits. i don't think i will ever be able to score above 50k in word hunt... and many people can get to 6 digits (!!)

but you know what i can do? build stuff. and so... introducing the word hunt destroyer!! a robot built to automatically use computer vision to search the board, generate the word options, and try them all using a stepper motor-driven stylus that plays the game at the speed of light. 

i started today by opening Onshape and creating a small sketch that serves as the base of the device. it is roughly shaped to fit my iPhone 14 Pro. there is a small extrusion in the upper right corner to fit the protruding camera. around the base i plan to have a separate holder for the webcam that views the board, the two stepper motors that control the stylus similarly to a 3D printer, and a fast mini servo to move the stylus up and down.
